                    Since when I was a kid, moved by the curiosity of how a website is made,
                    I started to study Web Languages by myself.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I started learning the basics, so HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then i moved to PHP with MySql Database; I understood
                    the big differences between Frontend and Backend and then I practised a lot.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Later on my road, I discovered React and React Native, and I fell in love. Nowadays I use them for building all of my 
                    best personal projects and for helping businesses to reach their goals.
